| Upscale worker and control plane nodes   | :white_check_mark: | - Possible to scale up contol plane and worker nodes. It is necessary to just add nodes to config file and execute 'rke up' | :white_check_mark: | - Possible to scale up contol plane and worker nodes. It is necessary to add new nodes to config file, switch some flags and execute 'epicli apply' | :white_check_mark: | - Possible to scale up contol plane and worker nodes. It is necessary to add new nodes to config filen and execute 'ansible-playbook'<br /> - https://kubespray.io/#/docs/nodes | :x: | - No informations how to do it on prem |
| Downscale worker and control plane nodes | :white_check_mark: | - Possible to scale down contol plane and worker nodes. It is necessary to remove nodes from config file and execute 'rke up' | :x: | - | :white_check_mark: | - Possible to scale down contol plane and worker nodes. It is necessary to remove nodes from config file and execute 'ansible-playbook'<br /> - https://kubespray.io/#/docs/nodes | :x: | - No informations how to do it on prem |
| Installation approach                    | Hypercube | - Single binary file which contains all set of core Kubernetes components, e.g. API, Scheduler, Controller, etc. The problem with this approach is that bug-fix for API causes update of all core Kubernetes containers. Only single endpoint to download the binary. Kubernetes components as Docker containers - also kubelet.<br /> - Installs all required system packages automatically with one exception : docker-ce must be pre-installed on all nodes :warning:<br /> - Own solution for setting up a cluster based on the GO language | Kubeadm | - Based on python and ansible tool, uses kubeadm | Kubeadm | - Can be managed using pre-built docker images form quay.io, ansible based<br /> - Installs all required system packages automatically  | Kubeadm | - Installed from a single statically-linked binary, based on Ansible and Kubeadm<br /> - Installs all required system packages automatically |
| Support Single Node mode                 | :white_check_mark: | -                  | :white_check_mark: | - | :white_check_mark: | -                  | :white_check_mark: | -                  |
| Support HA-mode                          | :white_check_mark: | - https://rancher.com/docs/rancher/v2.x/en/installation/resources/k8s-tutorials/ha-rke/<br /> - By default the kubelets and kube-proxies are configured to connect to nginx-proxy service that proxies all requests to all master nodes | :white_check_mark: | - https://github.com/epiphany-platform/epiphany/blob/develop/docs/design-docs/kubernetes-ha/kubernetes-ha.md<br /> - Based on idea from kubespray HA-mode, on every node lightweight load-balancer is installed that proxies all requests to all master nodes | :white_check_mark: | - On every non master node lightweight load-balancer (nginx proxy) is installed that proxies all requests to all master nodes | :white_check_mark: | - Very poorly documented. Only master components are configured out of the box in HA mode, in order to achieve full high availability we should apply manually a similar solution as in Epiphany |

| Cluster state file                       | :white_check_mark: | - State file is created by default what can be very useful in case of module approach | :x: | - | :x: | - | :x: | - |
| Kubeconfig extracted automatically       | :white_check_mark: | - Kubeconfig is automatically generated for the RKE cluster in local directory | :x: | - Only for installation process | :x: | - | :white_check_mark: | - Kubeconfig is automatically generated for the Kubeone cluster in local directory |

| Certificate Management                   | :white_check_mark: | - Default certificates are valid for 10 years<br /> - Possible to use custom certificates<br /> - RKE has a 'rke cert' command and it is possible to easily rotate the certificates | :white_check_mark: | - Default certificates are valid for one year (possible to set custom value)<br /> - Possible to use custom CA certificates<br /> - Epiphany has a ability to renew the certificates | :white_check_mark: | - Certficates are valid by default for one year<br />  - There is no official possibility to use custom certificate<br /> - Kubespray supports rotating certificates used for etcd and Kubernetes components, but some manual steps may be required<br /> - https://kubespray.io/#/docs/upgrades?id=upgrade-considerations | :white_check_mark: | - Certficates are valid by default for one year<br /> - It is not officially documented but certificates are renew during cluster upgrade<br /> - There is no official possibility to use custom certificate |
